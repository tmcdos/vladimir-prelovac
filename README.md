# Vladimir Prelovac (test task)

A wiki box is commonly used in search engines in the sidebar. When the user clicks a link in the wikibox we want to animate to a new page, staying in the box.

See this video:

The task is to:

1. Reproduce the content and design of the first two wikibox pages as seen in the video as accurate as you can just by looking at this video
2. Create a pure CSS transition effect when link is clicked to be as close to the animation in the video as possible
3. Do this with minimum amount of code/data (vanilla js/css encouraged)
